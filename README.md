# Create React App Overview

This project was set up with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Commands

Within the project directory, the following commands can be used:

### `npm start`

Runs the development server.\
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser.

The app will auto-refresh when you make code changes.\
Any console errors or warnings will be visible.

### `npm test`

Learn more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Generates the production version of the app and places it in the `build` folder.\
The React app is bundled and optimized for the best performance.

Files are compressed and named with hashes.\
Your app is now ready for production deployment.

Refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is irreversible.**

If you need to customize the build configuration, you can run `eject`. This will copy all the configuration files (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, allowing you to tweak them as needed.
